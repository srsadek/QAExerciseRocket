# QA Exercise

## Overview

This tiny application have a few features including:

- a header with a title
- a footer with a button to add boxes and a separate button to remove boxes
- an area where we can see boxes with numbers in them show up on the screen

### Known Issues

1. Unfortunately, the developers didn't plan effectively for users clicking the `Remove Box` button if there aren't any boxes present. What tests could we add for this?
2. Users can only add up to 20 boxes. What tests could we run to ensure this is true?
3. The last QA Engineer left a test broken. Could you fix it?

## Steps

1. Ensure you have Google Chrome installed. Otherwise, you'll need to reconfigure Cypress to work with your browser of choice.
2. Clone the application `git clone https://github.com/RocketPartners/qa-exercise.git`
3. Install dependencies `npm install`
   - Need `npm`? Install from [NodeJs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
4. Run `npm run start` and examine the application
5. Write tests using Cypress for the application
   - See `cypress/integration/spec.js`
   - Reference the Cypress [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress)
6. Validate your tests running `npm run cypress`
7. Email a plaintext file of `spec.js` to `qarecruiting@rocketpartners.io`
   - If you make additional changes to the project, please submit a zip file of the project instead
