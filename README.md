# QA Exercise

## Overview

This is a simple cypress script to test a small application (developed by rocket partner) that has a few features including:

- a header with a title
- a footer with a button to add boxes and a separate button to remove boxes
- an area where we can see boxes with numbers in them show up on the screen

### Known Issues
-there's bug left in the application on purpose by the developer

## Steps

1. Ensure you have Google Chrome installed. Otherwise, you'll need to reconfigure Cypress to work with your browser of choice.
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
   - Need `npm`? Install from [NodeJs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Run `npm run start` and examine the application
4. To run cypress test manually, run npx cypress open. this should open the cypress test runner window.
5. click on spec.js. this will open chrome browser of your choice and run the test
